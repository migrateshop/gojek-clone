## ✅ What Is a Gojek Clone?

A [Gojek Clone](https://migrateshop.com/gojek-clone/) is a ready-made app script designed to replicate the functionality of the Gojek super app. It allows entrepreneurs to offer 100+ services—like ride-hailing, food delivery, home services, parcel delivery, and more—under one platform.

The clone comes with separate apps and panels for customers, service providers, stores, drivers, and the admin, making it a complete end-to-end solution.

## 🔧 How Does the Gojek Clone App Work?

Here's a step-by-step overview of how the app functions for all users involved:

- **User Registration & Login**  
Customers, vendors, drivers, and service providers sign up using email, mobile number, or social logins with OTP verification.

- **Service Browsing & Booking**  
Users browse services (e.g., taxi, food delivery, handyman) via categorized listings, apply filters, and book instantly or schedule later.

- **Real-Time Assignment**  
Orders or requests are auto-assigned to the nearest available provider/delivery agent using location-based algorithms.

- **Live Tracking & Communication**  
Users can track service providers live, call/chat with them, and receive push notifications at every step.

- **Secure Payment & Ratings**  
After service completion, users pay using various methods (wallet, card, UPI), and leave ratings and reviews.

- **Admin Monitoring**  
Admin can monitor all activity from the backend dashboard, manage commissions, handle disputes, and analyze performance reports.
